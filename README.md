# Facial_recognition_Ahtesham
This idea is based on Machine Learning.  _* A situation arrises, in an event or in a function where there  are many people gathered together at one place.    Some unknown persons enter into that event unrecognised and unnoticed these unknowns can cause a big harm to the guests of that event .  To overcome these situations I have developed a prototype run time "Facial Recognition software" based on Machine Learning which will identify those unauthorized entry . Thus security will improve.  I will try to use the best algorithm possible to identify faces accurately.  In future this software can be used by various event organizers which will definitely improve the safety of their premises and clients.
